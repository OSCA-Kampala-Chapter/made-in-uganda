# Code of Conduct
We are dedicated to providing a positive and harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, ethnicity, race, religion, nationality, or level of experience. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form, nor do we tolerate any behavior that would reasonably lead to another individual's participant being made to feel unsafe, insecure, or frightened for their physical or emotional well-being. All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds.

Examples of encouraged behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

Using welcoming and inclusive language
Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
Focusing on what is best for everyone 
Showing empathy towards other participants
Unacceptable behavior includes:

The use of sexualized language or imagery, or inappropriate physical contact, sexual attention, or advances
Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, personal or political attacks, or sustained disruption of talks or other events
Deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, or harassing photography or recording
Harassment of any kind, even in a joking or ironic manner
Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate at this event.

Each participant is entirely responsible for their own actions.

Thank you for helping to make this a welcoming, friendly space for all.
